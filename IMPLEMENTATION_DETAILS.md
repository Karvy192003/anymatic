# Implementation Details

## Overview

This document provides details about the implementation of founder profile images and OpenAI API integration for the Anymate application.

## 1. Founder Profile Images

### Implementation

We've created and added profile images for all three founders:

- Created SVG placeholder images for Karvy Goyel and Sachit
- Updated the `HomePage.tsx` file to use local image paths instead of placeholder URLs

### File Locations

- `/public/images/karvy-goyel.jpg` - Karvy Goyel's profile image
- `/public/images/sachit.jpg` - Sachit's profile image
- `/public/images/satvik-dubey.jpg` - Satvik Dubey's profile image (existing)

### Code Changes

In `HomePage.tsx`, we updated the founders array to use the local image paths:

```jsx
const founders = [
  {
    name: 'Karvy Goyel',
    role: 'Co-founder & Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)',
    img: '/images/karvy-goyel.jpg',
    bio: `Karvy is a visionary marketer and co-founder who blends creative storytelling with strategic precision. As CMO, she leads brand growth and customer engagement with bold ideas and data-driven execution.`
  },
  {
    name: 'Sachit',
    role: 'Co-founder & Chief Executive Officer (CEO)',
    img: '/images/sachit.jpg',
    bio: `Sachit sets the vision and pace of the company. As CEO and co-founder, he ensures our product, mission, and culture move forward together with clarity and purpose.`
  },
  {
    name: 'Satvik Dubey',
    role: 'Co-founder & Chief Technology Officer (CTO)',
    img: '/images/satvik-dubey.jpg',
    bio: `Satvik drives our tech innovation. As CTO and co-founder, he builds systems that scale, leads engineering with precision, and ensures we stay ahead in product development.`
  }
];
```

## 2. OpenAI API Integration

### Implementation

We've set up the OpenAI API integration for the LLM features:

1. Created a `sample.env` file with OpenAI API configuration variables
2. Implemented a comprehensive `openaiService.ts` utility
3. Created an example `AIContentGenerator` component
4. Updated the `ServicesPage.tsx` to include the AI Content Generator demo

### File Locations

- `/sample.env` - Sample environment variables for OpenAI API configuration
- `/src/services/openaiService.ts` - OpenAI API service implementation
- `/src/components/AIContentGenerator.tsx` - Example component using the OpenAI service
- `/OPENAI_INTEGRATION.md` - Detailed documentation for the OpenAI integration
- `/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Troubleshooting guide for Firebase and OpenAI issues

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for the OpenAI integration:

```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
VITE_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
VITE_OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7
VITE_OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=1000
VITE_OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
```

### Service Implementation

The `openaiService.ts` file provides:

1. Type definitions for OpenAI API requests and responses
2. Core API communication functions:
   - `generateCompletion` - For text completions
   - `generateChatCompletion` - For chat completions
3. Specialized educational content generation functions:
   - `generateEducationalContent` - Creates age-appropriate educational content
   - `generateQuizQuestions` - Creates multiple-choice questions with varying difficulty
   - `generateLearningPath` - Creates personalized learning paths
   - `generateStoryBasedExplanation` - Creates story-based explanations of concepts

### Example Component

The `AIContentGenerator.tsx` component demonstrates how to use the OpenAI service to generate different types of educational content:

1. Educational content for specific grade levels
2. Quiz questions with varying difficulty levels
3. Story-based explanations for different age groups

### ServicesPage Integration

We've updated the `ServicesPage.tsx` to include a section that demonstrates the AI Content Generator component, allowing users to try out the AI-powered content generation features directly on the services page.

## Documentation

We've created comprehensive documentation for the OpenAI integration:

1. `OPENAI_INTEGRATION.md` - Detailed documentation for developers
2. `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Guide for resolving common issues

## Next Steps

1. **API Key Security**: Ensure the OpenAI API key is properly secured and not committed to version control
2. **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling for API failures
3. **Caching**: Add caching for common requests to reduce API usage and costs
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent excessive API usage
5. **User Quotas**: Consider implementing user quotas for API usage
